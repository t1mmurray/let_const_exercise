1.
var is the least stable sort of variable declaration. You can redeclare variablese defined with var, but not with let. 
Var variables are also either scoped to the function or added to the window object, while let variables simlpy have block scope. 
2.
Var variables can be both redeclared and and reassigned, while const variables can do neither.
3.
Let variables can be reassigned, while const variables cannot. Let also allows for variable definition without a value, while const variables must be assigned an itnital value at declaration.
4.
Hoisting is the phenomenon in which var variable declarations are "run" first, so their values are undefined for JS until JS reaches the actual variables declaration.
